          <h2>WHY YOUR DIETS FAIL:</h2>
          <p class="content">Currently with the massive load of cabohydrates in  our foods, our bodies are conditioned to burn carbs for energy instead of fat. Because it is an easier energy source for the body to use up.</p>
          <h4 class="super"><br>The Problem</h4><br>
          <p class="content">
            1. Fat stores on the body as carbs are burned as an easy energy fuel. Essentialy we gain more weight year after year.<br><br>
            2. Carbs are not the body’s ideal source of energy therefore we are usually left feeling tired, stressed and drained at the end of each day.          </p>

          <h2>WHY <span class="orange">GETLEAN</span> WORKS!</h2>
          <p class="content"><br> Ketosis is the state where your body is actually burning fat for energy instead of carbs. Ketosis is extremely hard to obtain on your own and takes weeks to accomplish.GETLEAN actually helps your body achieve ketosis fast and helps you burn fat for energy instead of carbs!</p>
          <h4 class="super"><br> The Solution:</h4><br>
          <p class="content">
            1. When your body is in ketosis, you are actually burning stored fat for energy and not carbs!<br><br>
            2. Fat IS the body’s ideal source of energy and when you are in ketosis you experience energy and mental clarity like never before and of course very rapid weight loss.          </p>

            <p class="content">
              GETLEAN contains Beta-hydroxybutyrate. BHB is the first substrate that kicks the metabolic state of ketosis into action. Revisiting the scenario from before, if you either take supplemental forms or if your body is making beta-hydroxybutyrate, it is able to start processing in your body resulting in energy.            </p>
            <p class="content">
              Beta-hydroxybutyrate floats around in your blood, and importantly, can cross different important barriers to be able to be turned into energy at all times. One of the most important areas where this happens is in the brain. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is usually a very tightly regulated interface, but since BHB is such a rock star and so hydrophilic, your brain knows to let it in so it can bring energy to the party at any time. This is one of the main reasons why increased BHB levels lead to heightened mental acuity.*<br>
              <br>Get slim, healthy,  and confident again with our unique GETLEAN supplement. Ideal for both men  and women,  GETLEAN is a dynamic and powerful ketosis dietary  supplement that will assist weight loss, promote abdominal fat burn, and  support better digestion and sleep.* <br>

            <h3>EATING GETLEAN FRIENDLY</h3>
            <p>The best way to support your GETLEAN journey is with a diet that consists primarily of fat, with moderate protein and low carbohydrate intake. For best results, aim for a ratio of 70% fat, 25% protein, and 5% carbohydrates.<br><br>
            <h3>TIPS FOR SUCCESS</h3>
            <p>Before you begin, you are encouraged to take a "before" photo and an inventory of your body measurements, energy level, mental clarity, and overall sense of wellbeing so you can track your results. It's also wise to get plenty of rest and consult your healthcare professional before starting any health program.</p>
            <p>Once you are in a state of nutritional ketosis, staying in ketosis is as simple as maintaining a keto-friendly diet, plenty of exercise, and enjoying all the benefits  GETLEAN has to offer.</p>
            <p>Don't worry! It's OK to spring for dessert or splurge at the buffet at your next family gathering -  GETLEAN BodyTone is always there for you when you need it.</p>

		<p>It is safe to use by adult men and women – 18 years and older. As with any supplement, we suggest consulting a health care professional prior to use if you have any pre-existing medical conditions and/or are taking any prescription medication.</p>

		<h3>Herbal Safety Guidelines</h3>
		<p>Before using an herb you are unfamiliar with, find out its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly and/or consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition, check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs medicinally. Herbs have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. The following are merely guidelines. They include herbs offered on our websites. This list does not help with administering information on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine. This needs to be discussed with your physician.</p>
		<p>Should I check with my doctor or healthcare provider before using a supplement? This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups. Dietary supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and mineral supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.</p>

		<p>We consider Chargebacks and reversals as potential cases of fraudulent use of our services and/or theft of services, and will be treated as such. We reserve the right to file a complaint with the appropriate local and federal authorities to investigate. Be advised that all activity and IP address information is being monitored and that this information may be used in a civil and/or criminal case(s) against a client if there is fraudulent use and or theft of services.</p>

		<p>Customer satisfaction is our main priority, and we are always interested in making our customers' experience with our products enjoyable and convenient. If you would like to request custom arrangements for your account, such as bulk orders, and/or ordering additional products, just call our customer service representatives and we will be happy to discuss your account with you.
